        <p>Cosmopolitan magazine was briefly officially titled as Hearst's International Combined with Cosmopolitan in 1952, but was simply referred to as Cosmopolitan. <br> In 1911, Hearst had bought a middling monthly magazine called World To-Day and renamed it Hearst's Magazine in April 1912. <br> In June 1914 it was shortened to Hearst's and was ultimately titled Hearst's International in May 1922. <br> In order to spare serious cutbacks at San Simeon, Hearst merged the magazine Hearst's International with Cosmopolitan effective March 1925.</p>
